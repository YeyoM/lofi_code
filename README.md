## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://lofi-terminal.vercel.app/)

### What is Lofi?
Lofi refers to a recording with less than professional or flawed sound quality. “Lo-fi” is short for “low fidelity,” and initially referred to a low-quality recording with audible imperfections, such as background noise or performance mistakes, recorded with inexpensive equipment—the opposite of high fidelity or hi-fi production.

- Lofi music can reduce stress and enhance focus, resulting in quality study sessions.
- Lofi and other musical styles can help students reduce distractions while boosting brain activity.

Slower, relaxing music can improve your mood by increasing serotonin and dopamine levels. A study from Montreal's McGill University found that music listeners receive up to a 9% boost in dopamine levels. This boost in brain chemicals can enhance studying by keeping developers and students focused and relaxed.

In addition to elevating mood and increasing brain activity, lo-fi music offers a solid list of benefits that can help you make the most of your studying. Keep reading to learn more about the benefits of lofi music.
